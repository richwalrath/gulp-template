## Executing Your Gulp Tasks
Running your **gulp** tasks is pretty simple. All you need to do is open your command prompt,
navigate to the project root directory and enter: **gulp**

If all is setup correctly this should run your tasks and hopefully your build should complete
successfully.

If you encounter an error saying that **gulp** is not a recognized application or command then you
can try installing **gulp** globally with this command: **npm install -g gulp**
