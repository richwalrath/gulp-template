## Getting the Dependencies
First if you don't know you need **node.js**. Once you have that installed come back and we'll
continue. I'll be right here waiting...

Got it! Good! Lets begin...

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to where you saved your local repository.
2. Run the command: **npm install**
  - This will get all of the dependencies listed in **package.json** and store them in a folder named **node_modules**

If at any point you wish to add or remove dependencies just modify the **package.json** file. It
should be mentioned however that the **node_modules** folder doesn't self-clean so the easiest way
to make sure you don't have left-over dependencies that aren't wanted any-more is to delete the folder
and re-install.
