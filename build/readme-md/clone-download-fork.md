## Clone, Download or Fork
Using the GitHub UI or your favorite Git client you can grab this repository in a number of ways:

* **GitHub Clone or Download** - On the top-right of the files list on GitHub you'll see a
**Clone or download** button. Clicking that button with give you options to download or instructions
on how to clone the repository to your computer. This provides a URL that can be used in your Git
clients to grab a copy of the repository. Keep in mind you won't be able to push back to the master.
* **GitHub Forking** - Forking is where you create a new copy of the repository on your GitHub
account. This has the benefits of being able to keep a link to the original while allowing you to do
whatever you want with the copy. After forking you can just point your Git client to your copy and
you will be able to **push** and **pull** from it as needed. It also allows **rebasing** which is
nice but can be kind-of a headache. In order to Fork the repository you'll see a button in the
top-right called 'Fork' (you may be asked to authenticate so it knows where to send the fork).
Clicking this button will create a fork on your account.

What we recommend is that you Fork it if you have a GitHub account. This allows you to keep a link
between this repository and your forked repository but allow you to make your own version to suit
your needs.
